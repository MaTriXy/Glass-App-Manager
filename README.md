Glass-App-Manager
=================

A simple app manager for Google Glass. This application can be used to view and uninstall applications that were added using the GDK. It's just a quick solution to remove the hassle of trying to find the original package names in order to remove them via adb. The application can be triggered by saying, "Ok Glass, uninstall an app"
